Design a group of classes to work with geometric figures. Put them into namespaces. 
You do not need to implement the classes, just create them and put them into namespaces. 
Make sure the files are placed in directories corresponding to the namespaces.
Namespace Geometry.Geometry2D holds classes:
•	Point2D
•	Figure2D
•	Square
•	Rectangle
•	Polygon
•	Circle
•	Ellipse
•	DistanceCalculator2D
Namespace Geometry.Geometry3D holds classes:
•	Point3D
•	Path3D
•	DistanceCalculator3D
Namespace Geometry.Storage holds classes:
•	GeometryXMLStorage
•	GeometryBinaryStorage
•	GeometrySVGStorage
Namespace Geometry.UI holds classes:
•	Screen2D
•	Screen3D
